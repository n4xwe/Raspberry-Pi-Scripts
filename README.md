# RPi-Scripts
BASH Scripts that Install Ham Radio Software on the Raspberry Pi

These BASH scripts install either GNU Radio, WSJT-X, PiHPSDR, Fldigi, tweaktime or QSSTV on a Raspberry Pi using the most recent Bookworm 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi (fomerly Raspbian) Operating System or the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Operating System. The scripts titled rpi-bookworm64(name of the package) have been tested on an 8GB RPi 5 running the May 13, 2025, release of the Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit version. The scripts titled rpi-ubuntu22.04LTS-(name of the package) have been tested (unless otherwise noted) on an 8GB RPi 4 running Ubuntu 22.04 ARM 64-bit. 

In order for the script to function correctly you must have a reasonable connection to the Internet.  The suggested method of launching the scripts is to create a separate directory named src off of the $HOME directory (/home/$USER/src).  Copy the script file to the src directory.  Using the Command Line change the file permissions of the script to allow its execution (chmod +x name-of-the script.sh).  The same result can be achieved on the Bullseye Desktop by doing a right click on your script and choosing Properties from the pop-up menu, then switch to the Permissions tab, opposite "Execute" change Nobody to Anyone.  To start the script from the Command Line preface the script name with a dot slash (./name-of-the-script.sh) and press the Enter key.  

The script will update all of the packages on your Operating System to their latest versions.  It will also locate, download and install all of the required dependencies and the requisite source code.  In many instances there are statements in the scripts that place icons on the Desktop and provide initial configuration of the software.  In the case of GNU Radio, the script installs two Python configuration statements but the OS must be rebooted to enable them.  

Most of the scripts have detailed inline comments that explain the function of every line in the script.  They are offered under GPL v3.0 and can be easily modified by any user.  Approximate runtimes for the scripts are included in the script descriptions.  The exact runtime depends on a number of factors including the state of the packages on your system and the speed of your Internet connection.

PiHPSDR, by John Melton, G0ORX, is an excellent lightweight SDR Console that works with a variety of radios.  It uses the WDSP 1.18 library for signal processing, has the capability of implementing Puresignal adaptive pre-distortion, has an intuitive interface and is very stable. PiHPSDR interfaces with other programs through the Pulseaudio transport system.  There is a version of the script that supports the Rasbian OS and one that supports the Raspberry Pi flavor of Ubuntu Mate. The current release of PiHPSDR is 2.08-rc1. Script runtime time on a Raspberry Pi 4 is approximately 10 minutes.

GNU Radio, originally developed by Eric Blossom, K7GNU, and Matt Ettus, N2MJI, is a powerful DSP toolkit. It has a graphical interface that allows allows almost any DSP function to be performed on RF derived signals.  Script runtime on a Raspberry Pi 4 is roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes.  The rpi-Ubuntu22.04MATE-gnuradio3.8.5-grnet-digital_rf-osmosdr-hpsdr-setup.sh script was built for the HamSCI Tangerine-SDR project and works only on Ubuntu MATE 22.04 64-bit for the Raspberry Pi.  It installs GNU Radio 3.8.5 and builds the gr-grnet, gr-digital_rf, (limited) gr-osmosdr and gr-hpsdr blocks into the GNU Radio Companion. The script also builds the HPSDR and many of the RTL-SDR source blocks. Script runtime time on a Raspberry Pi 4 is approximately 125 minutes.

WSJT-X by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and currently supported by a group of very talented developers is weak signal software that includes, among other programs, FT8, FT4, JT8 and WSPR. The script also compiles the most recent version of the Hamlib library for integrated rig control,  Script runtime on a Raspberry Pi 4 is 20 minutes.

Fldigi by Dave Freese, W1HKJ and others is a digital mode console with integrated Hamlib rig control.  This console handles a multitude of digital modes including PSK-31, WeatherFax, Hellschreiber and CW.  The script installs Hamlib 4.5.5, fldigi 4.2.03, rigctl 2.0.05 and flwkeyer 1.2.3. Script runtime on a Raspberry Pi 5 is approximately 20 minutes.

Dream is an AM/DRM software receiver written in C++ and Qt. Script runtime on a Raspberry Pi 4 is approximately 20 minutes.  The script for compiling Dream is currently a Work in Progress

tweaktime, by Matt Roberts, KK5JY allows adjusting the system clock to provide accurate time synchronization for WSJT-X using the DT values in the WSJT-X GUI. Please take a look at the kk5jy.net webpage to find the instructions for using it.

QSSTV, by Johan Maes, ON4QZ, is an SSTV and file transfer program. It has a simple interface and is easy to use.  All around an excellent piece of software that is compatible with EasyPal and MMSSTV. The CAT function does not work in all Operating Systems. Script runtime time on a Raspberry Pi 4 is approximately 20 minutes.ware 

NanoVNA Saver is a software package that adds functionality, mainly hard copy graphing capability, to most versions of the NanoVNA hardware. It is currently not compiling correctly because of an inability to install PyQT6 on the the February 22, 2023 version of the Raspberry Pi OS.  This is due to a Python3 version hell issue (what else?) that will hopefully be corrected in short order.

2024 has arrived.  A few days before Christmas I was able to score a Raspberry Pi 5 at Gigaparts in Huntsville to replace my defunct RPi 4B.  To celebrate I have revised some scripts to compile on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm.  In my mind there is almost no comparison possible between the performance of the RPi4B and the RPi5. The RPi5 does generate significantly more heat.  Without cooling, I am using a Raspberry Pi Active Cooler, the CPU will overheat and throttle during compiles.
