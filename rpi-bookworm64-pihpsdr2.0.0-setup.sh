# The following instructions are specific to the iQuadLabs IQ2 transceiver

#If the Start button appears in the Discovery window, left click on it to start PiHPSDR.  If the Subnet! 
#notification appears, right click on the Network icon in the upper right corner of the desktop.  From 
#the menu that appears select "Wireless & Wired Network Settings" From the Network Preferences menu select
#Configure: interface eth0, check the box labled "Disable IPv6" in the IPv4 box insert an IP address
#that is on the Subnet of the IP address of the IQ2 (For example 192.168.1.10 for an IQ2 configured with
#the standard 192.168.1.25, no DHCP setting). Restart PiHPSDR. The Start button should appear the next time the
#PiHPSDR Discovery menu appears.

#When PiHPSDR starts for the first time it generates a wisdom file, which takes a few minutes, and a configuration file named [The MAC address of the RPi].props

#Shut down PiHPSDR and edit the [The MAC address of the RPi].props file to:
#change receivers=2 to receivers=1
#change receiver.1.sample_rate=48000 to =384000

#Start PiHPSDR.
